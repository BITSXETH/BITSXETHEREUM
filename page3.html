            <div class="text">What is ERC20?</div>
          <p class="para">ERC20 ,short for "Ethereum Request for Comment 20,"  is a standard interface for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It defines a set of functions that tokens must implement, allowing them to be compatible with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. These functions include transferring tokens, querying balances, and approving token spending.
         </p><br>
         <div class="text">Key Features</div>
                <p class="para"><b>Fungibility:</b> ERC20 tokens are fungible, meaning each token is interchangeable with another token of the same type. This characteristic facilitates seamless token exchange and interoperability within the Ethereum ecosystem.
                <br><br><b>Basic Functions:</b> ERC20 tokens include fundamental functions such as:
                <br><u>balanceOf(address):</u> Allows querying the balance of tokens held by a specific address.
                <br><u>transfer(address, uint256):</u> Enables transferring tokens from the sender's address to another address.
                <br><u>approve(address, uint256):</u> Permits another address to withdraw tokens from the sender's address.
                <br><br><b>Optional Functions:</b> In addition to the basic functions, ERC20 tokens may include optional functions such as:
                <br><u>allowance(address, address):</u> Allows checking the amount of tokens a spender is permitted to withdraw from a specific address.
                <br><u>transferFrom(address, address, uint256):</u> Facilitates transferring tokens on behalf of another address.
                <br><br><b>Events:</b> ERC20 tokens emit events to notify external entities about token transfers and approvals. These events enhance transparency and enable efficient tracking of token movements.
                <br><br><b>Token Metadata:</b> ERC20 tokens can include metadata such as the token name, symbol, and decimal places. This metadata enhances user-friendliness and ensures compatibility with wallets and exchanges.

               </p><br>
               <div class="text">Benefits</div>
                <p class="para"><b>Interoperability:</b> ERC20 standardization promotes interoperability, enabling seamless integration of tokens across various Ethereum-based applications, wallets, and exchanges.
                    <br><b>Widespread Adoption:</b> The ERC20 standard has gained widespread adoption, making it the de facto standard for token creation on the Ethereum blockchain.
                    <br><b>Tokenization:</b> ERC20 tokens facilitate the tokenization of various assets, allowing for the representation of real-world assets, digital collectibles, and utility tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

                <p class="para">In the Contract directory, locate a file named “Lock.sol.” Since it’s redundant, delete it. Then, generate a new Solidity file titled “MyToken.sol”.Following is the code for deploying a ERC20 token.<br>
                     <img src="erc20.png"><br><br>
                
                     <b>import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
                  <br>   import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";</b>

<br><br>These lines import two Solidity contracts from the OpenZeppelin library.
<br>ERC20.sol: This contract provides the implementation of the ERC20 standard for fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
<br>Ownable.sol: This contract provides basic authorization control functions, simplifying the implementation of user permissions.
<br><br>Next section defines the constructor function of the "AlphaToken" contract.

<br>-mapping(address => uint26) public balances; declares a public mapping
called "balances" that associates Ethereum addresses with unsigned 26-bit integer
<br>-constructor(address initialOwner): This is the constructor function, which is executed only once during contract deployment. It takes an "initialOwner" address as an argument.
<br>-ERC20("AlphaToken", "ATK"): This calls the constructor of the "ERC20" contract with two arguments: the name of the token ("AlphaToken") and its symbol ("ATK").
<br>-Ownable(initialOwner): This calls the constructor of the Ownable contract with "initialOwner" as the owner of the contract.
<br>-_mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10 ** decimals()): This mints 1,000,000 tokens and assigns them to the contract deployer "(msg.sender)". The number is multiplied by 10 raised to the power of "decimals()", which is a function inherited from the ERC20 contract that returns the number of decimals for the token (typically 18).
<br><br>The function mint allows the owner of the contract to mint new tokens and assign them to a specified address.
<br>-public: This function can be called externally.
<br>-onlyOwner: This is a modifier from the "Ownable" contract that restricts the function to be callable only by the owner of the contract.
<br>-_mint(to, amount): This function is inherited from the "ERC20" contract and is used to mint new tokens and assign them to the specified address "(to)" with the specified amount "(amount)".
<br><br>The function "balanceof" and takes an Ethereum address "_user" as input.
<br>-It's a public view function, meaning it can be called from outside the contract and doesn't modify the state.
<br>-It overrides a function from an inherited contract/interface.
<br>-It returns the balance of the "_user" by accessing the balances mapping with "_user" as the key.
<br><br>The function named "mintToken" 
<br>-It checks if the caller "(msg.sender)" has at least 1000 tokens in their balance before minting.
<br>-If the condition is met, it adds 1000 tokens to the caller's balance.
<br>-It emits a "mintTokenEvent" event indicating that tokens have been minted.
<br><br>The function named "transfer" takes an address "_receiver" and a uint256 "amount" as parameters.
<br>-It's a public view function, which overrides a view function from an interface
<br>-It checks if the amount is not zero and if the sender (msg.sender) has enough tokens to transfer.
<br>-If conditions are met, it transfers the amount of tokens from the sender to the _receiver.
<br>-It emits a Transfer event indicating the transfer of tokens.

<br><br>The function named "approve"  takes an address "_delegate" and a uint256 "_amount" as parameters.
<br>-It overrides a function from an inherited contract/interface.
<br>-It allows "_delegate" to spend "_amount" of tokens on behalf of the caller (msg.sender).
<br><br>The function named allowance  takes two addresses "_owner" and "_delegate" as parameters.
<br>-It's a public view function, overriding a function from an inherited contract/interface.
<br>-It returns the amount of tokens that "_delegate" is allowed to spend on behalf of "_owner".

                    <br>It declares functions like <b>totalSupply(), balanceOf(), allowance(), transfer(),  and transferFrom()</b>, specifying their inputs, outputs, and access modifiers.
                    <br>It also includes events such as <b>Transfer</b> and <b>Approval</b>, which are emitted to notify external clients about token transfers and approvals
                    
                    <br><br><b>Contract MyToken</b>, is the main token contract  which inherits from <b>ERC20Interface</b> to implement the ERC20 standard functions and events

                    <br>It signals given metamask address has received <b>_totalSupply</b> tokens from the zero address <b>(address(0)),</b> effectively minting all tokens and assigning them to the specified address
                    <br><br>The function <b>totalSupply()</b> returns the total supply of tokens in circulation.
                    <br>It subtracts the balance of the zero address <b>(address(0))</b> from the <b>_totalSupply</b> to exclude any tokens assigned to the zero address.
                    <br>The result is the total supply of tokens that are held by token holders.

                    <br><br>The <b>transfer(address to, uint tokens)</b> function allows the sender to transfer tokens to another address <b>(to)</b>.

                    <br><br>The <b>transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens)</b> function allows an approved spender to transfer tokens from one address <b>(from)</b> to another <b>(to)</b>.

                    <br>Finally, it emits a <b>Transfer</b> event to notify listeners about the token transfer.
                    <br><br>The <b>allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender)</b> function returns the remaining number of tokens that the <b>spender</b> is allowed to spend on behalf of the <b>tokenOwner.</b>
